## Dataset
[CADP dataset](https://ankitshah009.github.io/accident_forecasting_traffic_camera) is used to train the deep learning model to detect traffic accident in CCTV video. We manually labeled the extracted image frames with label 0 for "no accident" and 1 for "accident". Only video frames corresponding to collision and "after effects" of collisions are considered labeled as "accident". If the after effect of the collision already settled down, the video frames are back to being labeled as "no accident".

## Deep Learning Model
CNN + LSTM model is implemented using DL4J framework to detect traffic accidents in CCTV video frames.
The CCTV video sequence classification is done in "many-to-many" fashion, i.e. every frame of the CCTV video is classified as either "accident" or "no accident" based on the current video frame and previously seen video frames.
