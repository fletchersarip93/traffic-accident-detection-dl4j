CNN + LSTM model is implemented using DL4J framework to detect traffic accidents in CCTV video frames.
The CCTV video sequence classification is done in "many-to-many" fashion, i.e. every frame of the CCTV video is classified as either "accident" or "no accident" based on the current video frame and previously seen video frames.
